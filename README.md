# Home Together #
## Autonomous Home powered by **craft ai** ##

**HomeTogether** showcases the **craft ai** AI platform in a SmartHome context,
this demo was presented at [CES 2016](http://www.craft.ai/blog/home-together-a-ces-demo/).

### Local development ###

The following environment variables are required, for example in a `.env` file at the root

- `CRAFT_PROJECT_OWNER`: The **craft ai** project owner, e.g. _craft-ai_.
- `CRAFT_PROJECT_NAME`: The **craft ai** project name, e.g. _HomeTogether_.
- `CRAFT_PROJECT_VERSION`: The **craft ai** project name, e.g. _master_.
- `CRAFT_APP_ID`: The **craft ai** project application id.
- `CRAFT_APP_SECRET`: The **craft ai** project application secret.

#### Zipabox ####

Setting the following variables will enable the connection with the Zipabox API and the associated devices.

- `ZIPABOX_USER`: The username for the **Zipabox** access.
- `ZIPABOX_PASSWORD`: The password for the **Zipabox** access.
- `ZIPABOX_BLIND_DEVICE_UUID`: The **Zipabox** device UUID for the blind.
- `ZIPABOX_BLIND_ENDPOINT_UUID`: The **Zipabox** endpoint UUID for the blind.
- `ZIPABOX_LIGHT_SENSOR_DEVICE_UUID`: The **Zipabox** device UUID for the light sensor.
- `ZIPABOX_LIGHT_SENSOR_ENDPOINT_UUID`: The **Zipabox** endpoint UUID for the light sensor.

#### SAMI ####

In order to connect to the SAMI API and use the associated devices, you can set the following variables:

- `SAMI_CLIENT_ID`: The client ID for the **SAMI.IO** application.
- `SAMI_CLIENT_SECRET`: The client secret for the **SAMI.IO** application.
- `SAMI_BLIND`: The **SAMI.IO** device ID for the blind. Should instanciate a device type _craft ai blind_ (dtid _dt1b8e051f028f4b95a35452238c3684c4_).
- `SAMI_LIGHT_SENSOR`: The **SAMI.IO** device ID for the light sensor. Should instanciate a device type _craft ai light sensor_ (dtid _dt793c92541dcf4e99a79ded0444244168_).
- `SAMI_TV`: The **SAMI.IO** device ID for the TV. Should instanciate a device type _craft ai tv_ (dtid _dt3fdf857d42f943919d103aa3e0316052_).
- `SAMI_PRESENCE`: The **SAMI.IO** device ID for the indoor positioning system. Should instanciate a device type _craft ai ips_ (dtid _dtff8e26eaa7f04047ace3b5ff542a9696_).
- `SAMI_BULB_0` through `SAMI_BULB_5`: The **SAMI.IO** device ID for the bulbs of the rooms 0 through 5. Should instanciate a device type _craft ai bulb_ (dtid _dt6f3f2abffe33490695515a5ed26efd24_).

Note that your **SAMI.IO** application must have the permissions for reading and writing on each of the device types instantiated by your **SAMI.IO** devices.

#### Philips Hue ####

The application can connect to a **Philips Hue** bridge if one (or more) is detected on the network.
The following variables can be used to specify the use of the **Philips Hue** bridge and bulbs:

- `HUE_PREFERRED_BRIDGE`: The ID of the bridge to connect to (in case several bridges are discovered).
- `HUE_BRIDGE_IP`: The IP of the bridge to connected to (in case you want to bypass the bridge discovery).
- `HUE_USER`: The user ID to use on the connected bridge (will create the given user if it does not exist on the bridge).
- `HUE_BULB_0` through `HUE_BULB_5`: The ID of the Hue light bulbs to use for the rooms 0 through 5.

#### LIFX ####

It is possible to enable the connection with **LIFX** light bulbs by setting the environment variable LIFX_TOKEN with a valid **LIFX** developer access token.
You can set the variables 'LIFX_BULB_0' through 'LIFX_BULB_5' to valid **LIFX** light bulb IDs in order to associate those light bulbs to the rooms 0 through 5.
